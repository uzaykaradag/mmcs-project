Certainly, here's the revised and organized fraud detection model:

### Sets and Parameters
- **I**: Set of transaction IDs.
- **J**: Set of priority types, \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
- **K**: Set of probability types, \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) (for transaction, description, and customer respectively).
- **B**: Set of banks, labeled as \(\{A, B, C, D, E\}\).

#### Parameters
- **\(a_i\)**: Amount of transaction \(i\).
- **\(date_i\)**: Date of transaction \(i\).
- **\(w_k\)**: Weight of probability type \(k\).
- **\(Priority_i\)**: Priority type of transaction \(i\).
- **\(cost_j\)**: Cost of employee hired to deal with priority type \(j\).
- **\(t_j\)**: Time cost to investigate according to the priority type \(j\).
- **\(from_i\), \(to_i\)**: Originating and destination bank of transaction \(i\).
- **\(p_{k,i}\)**: Probability type \(k\) of transaction \(i\).
- **\(M_b\)**: Number of investigators in bank \(b\).
- **\(E_{m,n}\)**: Investigation time cost by bank \(m\) for transactions between banks \(m\) and \(n\).

### Decision Variables
- **\(x_i\)**: 1 if transaction \(i\) is investigated, 0 otherwise.
- **\(y_i\)**: 1 if an employee is hired to investigate transaction \(i\), 0 otherwise.
- **\(z_i\)**: 1 if transaction \(i\) is identified as a scam, 0 otherwise.

### Objective Function
Minimize the total cost of investigation and employee hiring:
\[ \min \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{k \in K} (w_k \cdot p_{k,i} \cdot a_i \cdot (1 - x_i)) + \sum_{i \in I} y_i \cdot cost_{Priority_i} \]

### Constraints
1. **Transaction Investigation Constraints for Each Bank (A, B, C, D, E)**:
   - Define \(I' = \{i \in I | y_i = 0\}\).
   - Constraints for each bank ensuring that the time and cost of investigations do not exceed the available resources and prioritizing transactions based on certain criteria.

2. **Binary Constraints**:
   - \(x_i, y_i \in \{0, 1\}\) for all \(i \in I\).

### Iterative and Outcome Process
- Change the objective function as per the iterative methods described.
- For each iteration, adjust weights \(w_k\) based on the outcome \(z_i\).
- Calculate new weights as a function of the accuracy of the predictions in previous iterations.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that all notations and formulas are consistent and clearly defined.
- Validate the model with different parameters and scenarios to assess its effectiveness.
- Include considerations for data privacy and regulatory compliance.
- Ensure the scalability of the model for handling large volumes of transactions.

This model provides a structured approach to detect and prioritize fraudulent transactions while balancing the costs and resources involved in the investigation process.
